New features in this version:

  - support for optional field access via `'field.?`. This allows to optionally extract / modify
    a field of a json object independent of its former existence. The new lens can be used in
    conjunction with those operations:
      - `set` will create a previously missing field
      - `modifyOrDeleteField` can modify or remove a field based on its previous value
      - `setOrUpdateField` can create a new or modify a previous field value
  - JsonPathSupport now generally translates field access to the optional field lens.
