New features in this version:
  * support for optional field access via 'field.?
    This allows to optionally extract / modify a field of a json object independent of its former
    existence. The new lens can be used in conjunction with those operations:
      * `set` will create a previously missing field
      * `modifyOrDeleteField` can modify or remove field based on the previous field value
      * `setOrModifyField` can create a new or modify a previous field value
  * JsonPathSupport now generally translates field access to the optional field lens.
